The course offers in-depth instruction on data collection, data management, programming, and visualization, using data examples relevant to academic research. 0.2 Time and place This course meets in Room 120 of the Environmental Health Building on Mondays and Wednesdays, 10:00 am–12:00 pm. Exceptions to these meeting times are: There will be no meeting on Wednesday, Aug. 31. There will be no meeting on Labor Day (Monday, Sept. 5). To make up for missing class on Aug. 31, we will have a supplemental class on Friday, Sept. 9, 10:00 am–12:00 pm. You will not lose attendance points if you cannot attend this class, but will be responsible for the material covered. There are no course meetings the week of Thanksgiving. 0.3 Detailed schedule Here is a more detailed view of the schedule for this course for Fall 2016: Dates Level Lecture content Graded items Aug. 22, 24 Preliminary R Preliminaries Aug. 29 Basic Entering and cleaning data Sept. 7, Sept. 9* Basic Exploring data Quiz (W) Sept. 12, 14 Basic Reporting data results Quiz (M), HW #1 (W) Sept. 19, 21 Basic Reproducible Research Quiz (M) Sept. 26, 28 Intermediate Entering and cleaning data Quiz (M), HW #2 (W) Oct. 3, 5 Intermediate Exploring data Quiz (M) Oct. 10, 12 Intermediate Reporting data results Quiz (M), HW #3 (W) Oct. 17, 19 Intermediate Reproducible Research Quiz (M) Oct. 24, 26 Advanced Entering and cleaning data Quiz (M), HW #4 (W) Oct. 31, Nov. 2 Advanced Exploring data Project proposal (M) Nov. 7, 9 Advanced Reporting data results HW #5 (W) Nov. 14, 16 Advanced Mapping in R Nov. 28, 30 Advanced Package development 1 HW #6 (W) Dec. 5, 7 Advanced Package development 2 Project draft (M) Week of Dec. 12 Group presentations Final project (M) 0.4 Grading Course grades will be determined by the following five components: Assessment component Percent of grade Final group project 30 Weekly in-class quizzes, weeks 3-10 25 Homework 25 Attendance and class participation 10 Weekly in-course group exercises 10 0.4.1 Attendance and class participation Because so much of the learning for this class is through interactive work in class, it is critical that you come to class. Out of a possible 10 points for class attendance, you will get: 10 points if you attend all classes 8 points if you miss one class 6 points if you miss two classes 4 points if you miss three classes 2 points if you miss four classes 0 points if you miss five or more classes 0.5 Weekly in-course group exercises Part of each class will be spent doing in-course group exercises. Ten points of your final grade will be based on your participation in these exercises. As long as you are in class and participate in these exercises, you will get full credit for this component. If you miss a class, to get credit towards this component of your grade, you will need to turn in a one-page document describing what you learned from doing the in-course exercise on your own time. All in-class exercises are included in the online course book at the end of the chapter on the associated material. 0.5.1 In-class quizzes You will have eight total in-class quizzes. You will have one for each of the Week 2–10 class meetings. There will be at least 10 questions per quiz. You will get 1/3 point for each correct answer. If you do the math, you can get full credit for this if you get at least 75% of your answers right. You can not get more than the maximum of 25 points for this component– once you reach 25 points on quizzes, you will have achieved full credit for the quiz component of the course grade. All quiz questions will be multiple choice, matching, or some other form of “close-answered” question (i.e., no open-response-style questions). You can not make up a quiz for a class period you missed. You can still get full credit on your total possible quiz points if you miss a class, but it means you will have to work harder and get more questions right for days you are in class. Because grading format for these quizzes allows for you to miss some questions and still get the full quiz credit for the course, I will not ever re-consider the score you got on a previous quiz, give points back for a wrong answer on a poorly-worded question, etc. However, if a lot of people got a particular question wrong, I will be sure to cover it in the next class period. Also, especially if a question was poorly worded and caused confusion, I will work a similar question into a future quiz– in addition to the 10 guaranteed questions for that quiz– so every student will have the chance to get an extra 1/3 point of credit for the question. The “Vocabulary” appendix of our online book has the list of material for which you will be responsible for this quiz. Most of the functions and concepts will have been covered in class, but some may not. You are responsible for going through the list and, if there are things you don’t know or remember from class, learning them. To do this, you can use help functions in R, Google, StackOverflow, books on R, ask a friend, and any other resource you can find. In general, using R frequently in your research or other coursework will help you to prepare and do well on these quizzes. 0.5.2 Homework There will be six homework assignments, starting a few weeks into the course and then due approximately every two weeks (see the detailed schedule in the online course book for exact due dates). Homeworks should be done individually. You will get many chances to work with others during in-course exercises and your final group project, but these homeworks should be a chance to assess how well you understand and can use the course material on your own. Homeworks will be graded for correctness, but some partial credit will be given for questions you try but fail to answer correctly. If you can’t completely do a required task, be sure to show and explain what you tried to do to complete it. Homework is due by the start of class on the due date. Your grade will be reduced by 10 points for each day it is late, and will receive no credit if it is late by over a week. 0.5.3 Final group project You will do the final group project in groups of 2–3. The final product will be a statistical blog post-style article of 1,500 words or less and an accompanying Shiny web application. Come up with an interesting question you’d love to get the answer to that you think you can find data to help you answer. You will need to use the data you find, and R, to write your article. The final product will be a Word document created from an RMarkdown file and an accompanying Shiny web application. Here are some articles to give you an idea of the style and content for this project: Does Christmas come earlier each year? Hilary: the most poisoned baby name in US history Every Guest Jon Stewart Ever Had On “The Daily Show” Should Travelers Avoid Flying Airlines That Have Had Crashes in the Past? Billion-Dollar Billy Beane You will have in-class group work time during weeks 10–15 to work on this. This project will also require some work with your group outside of class. You will be able to get feedback from me through weekly informal written reports in these weeks. I will also provide feedback and help during the in-class group work time. The final group project will be graded with A through F, with the following point values (out of 25 possible): 25 points for an A 20 points for a B 15 points for a C 10 points for a D 5 points for an F If you turn nothing in, you will get 0 points. We will discuss expectations for this project, create groups, etc. around the middle of the semester. The focus for this will be on finding, cleaning, and using good data to answer an interesting question, and on presenting, summarizing, and explaining the data well. 0.6 Helpful books for learning R There are three publishers that are leaders in good books for learning R: O’Reilly No Starch Press Springer Some particular books you might want to check out: R for Data Science R for Dummies R in a Nutshell R Cookbook R Graphics Cookbook A Beginner’s Guide to R Roger Peng’s Leanpub books "],

R in an open-source programming language that evolved from the S language. The S language was developed at Bell Labs in the 1970s, which is the same place (and about the same time) that the C programming language was developed. R itself was developed in the 1990s–2000s at the University of Auckland. It is open-source software, freely and openly distributed under the GNU General License. The base version of R that you download when you install R on your computer includes the critical code for running R, but you can also install and run “packages” that people all over the world have developed to extend R. With new developments, R is becoming more and more useful for a variety of programming tasks. However, where it really shines is in working with data and doing statistical analysis. R is currently popular in a number of fields, including: Statistics Machine learning Data journalism / data analysis R has some of the same strengths (quick and easy to code, interfaces well with other languages, easy to work interactively) and weaknesses (slower than compiled languages) as Python. For data-related tasks, R and Python are fairly neck-and-neck. However, R is still the first choice of statisticians in most fields, so I would argue that R has a an advantage if you want to have access to cutting-edge statistical methods. “The best thing about R is that it was developed by statisticians. The worst thing about R is that… it was developed by statisticians.” -Bo Cowgill, Google, at the Bay Area R Users Group 1.1.2 Open-source software R is open-source software. Many other popular statistical programming languages, conversely, are proprietary. It’s useful to know what it means for software to be “open-source”, both conceptually and in terms of how you will be able to use and add to R in your own work. R is free, and it’s tempting to think of open-source software just as “free software”. Things, however, are a little more subtle than that. It helps to consider some different meanings of the word “free”. “Free” can mean: Gratis: Free as in beer Libre: Free as in speech Open-source software software is the libre type of free. This means that, with software that is open-source, you can: Access all of the code that makes up the software Change the code as you’d like for your own applications Build on the code with your own extensions Share the software and its code, as well as your extensions, with others In practice, this means that, once you are familiar with the software, you can dig deeply into the code to figure out exactly how it’s performing certain tasks. This can be useful for finding bugs and eliminating bugs, and also can help researchers figure out if there are any limitations in how the code works for their specific research. It also means that you can build your own software on top of existing R software and its extensions. I explain a bit more about R packages a bit later, but this open-source nature of R (and other languages, including Python) has created a large community of people worldwide who develop and share extensions to R. As a result, you can pull in packages that let you do all kinds of things in R, like visualizing Tweets, cleaning up accelerometer data, analyzing complex surveys, fitting maching learning models, and a wealth of other cool things. 1.1.3 What is RStudio? To get the R software, you’ll download R from the R Project for Statistical Computing. This is enough for you to use R on your own computer. However, I would suggest one additional, free piece of software to improve your experience while working with R, RStudio. RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) for R. This basically means that it provides you an interface for running R and coding in R, with a lot of nice extras that will make your life easier. You download RStudio separately from R– you’ll want to download and install R itself first, and then you can download RStudio. You want the Desktop version with the free license. The company that develops this IDE is a fantastic contributer to the global R community. RStudio currently: Develops and freely provides the RStudio IDE Provides excellent resources for learning and using R (cheatsheets, ) Is producing some of the most-used R packages Employs some of the top people in R development R has been advancing by leaps in bounds in terms of what it can do and the elegance with which it does it, in large part because of the enormous contributions of people involved with RStudio. 1.1.4 Setting up If do not already have them, you will need to download and install both R and RStudio. Go to CRAN and download the latest version of R for your system. Install. Go to the RStudio download page and download the latest version of RStudio for your system. Install. Defaults should be fine for everything when you install both R and RStudio. You will want the latest stable version, rather than the development version, for this course. 1.2 The “package” system 1.2.1 R packages Your original download of R is only a starting point. To me, this is a bit like the toy train set that my son was obsessed with for a while. You first buy a very basic set that looks something like Figure 1.1. Figure 1.1: The toy version of base R. To take full advantage of R, you’ll want to add on packages. In the case of the train set, at this point, a doting grandparent adds on extensively through birthday presents, so you end up with something that looks like Figure 1.2. Figure 1.2: The toy version of what your R set-up will look like once you find cool packages to use for your research. The main source for installing packages for R remains the Comprehensive R Archive Network, or CRAN. However, GitHub is growing in popularity, especially for packages that are still in development. You can also create and share packages among your collaborators or co-workers, without ever posting them publicly. 1.2.2 Installing from CRAN The most popular place from which to get packages is currently CRAN. You can install packages from CRAN using R code. For example, telephone keypads include letters for each number (Figure 1.3), which allow companies to have “named” phone numbers that are easier for people to remember, like 1-800-GO-FEDEX and 1-800-FLOWERS. Figure 1.3: Telephone keypad with letters corresponding to each number. The phonenumber package is a cool little package that will convert between numbers and letters based on the telephone keypad. Since this package is on CRAN, you can install the package to your computer using the install.packages function: install.packages(&quot;phonenumber&quot;) This downloads the package from CRAN and saves it in a special location on your computer where R can load it when you’re ready to use it. 1.2.3 Loading an installed package Once you have installed a package, it will be saved to your computer, but you won’t be able to access it’s functions until you load it in your R session. You can load a package in an R session using the library function, with the package name inside the parentheses. library(phonenumber) One thing that people often find confusing when they start using R is knowing when to use and not use quotation marks. The general rule is that you use quotation marks when you want to refer to a character string literally, but no quotation marks when you want to refer to the value in a previously-defined object. For example, if you saved the string “Anderson” as the object my_name (my_name &lt;- “Anderson”), then in later code, if you type my_name (no quotation marks), you’ll get “Anderson”, while if you type out “my_name” (with quotation marks), you’ll get “my_name” (what you typed, literally). One thing that makes this rule confusing is that there are a few cases in R where you really should (by this rule) use quotation marks, but the function is coded to let you be lazy and get away without them. One example is the library function. In the above code, you want to literally load the package “phonenumber”, rather than load whatever character string is saved in the object named phonenumber. However, library is one of the functions where you can be lazy and skip the quotation marks, and it will still load “phonenumber” for you (although, if you want, this function also works if you follow the rule and call library(“phonenumber”) instead). Once a package is loaded, you can use all its exported (i.e., public) functions by calling them directly. For example, the phonenumber has a function called letterToNumber that converts a character string to a number. Once you’ve loaded phonenumber using library, you can use this function in your R session: fedex_number &lt;- &quot;GoFedEx&quot; letterToNumber(fedex_number) ## [1] &quot;4633339&quot; R vectors can have several different classes. One common class is the character class, which is the class of the character string we’re using here (“GoFedEx”). You’ll always put character strings in quotation marks. Another key class is numeric (numbers). Later in the course, we’ll introduce other classes that vectors can have, including factors and dates. 1.3 Basic code conventions of R 1.3.1 R’s MVP: The gets arrow The gets arrow, &lt;-, is R’s assignment operator. It takes whatever you’ve created on the right hand side of the &lt;- and saves it as an object with the name you put on the left hand side of the &lt;-. The basic structure of a call with a gets arrow looks like this: ## Note: Generic code [name of object] &lt;- [thing I want to save] Sometimes, we’ll show “generic” code in a code block, that doesn’t actually work if you put it in R, but instead shows the generic structure of an R call. We’ll try to always include a comment with any generic code, so you’ll know not to try to run it in R. For example, if I just type &quot;GoFedEx&quot; at the R prompt, R will print that string back to me, but won’t save it anywhere for me to use later: &quot;GoFedEx&quot; ## [1] &quot;GoFedEx&quot; However, if I assign &quot;GoFedEx&quot; to an object using a gets arrow, I can print it out or use it later by typing (“referencing”) that object name: fedex_number &lt;- &quot;GoFedEx&quot; fedex_number ## [1] &quot;GoFedEx&quot; letterToNumber(fedex_number) ## [1] &quot;4633339&quot; 1.3.2 Assignment operator wars: &lt;- vs. = You can make assignments in R using either the gets arrow (&lt;-) or =. When you read other people’s code, you’ll see both. R gurus advise using &lt;- rather than = when coding in R, and as you move to doing more complex things, some subtle problems might crop up if you use =. I have heard from someone in the know that you can tell the age of a programmer by whether he or she uses the gets arrow or =, with = more common among the young and hip. For this course, however, I am asking you to code according to Hadley Wickham’s R style guide, which specifies using the gets arrow for assignment. While you will be coding with the gets arrow exclusively in this course, it will be helpful for you to know that the two assignment arrows do pretty much the same thing: one_to_ten &lt;- 1:10 one_to_ten ## [1] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 one_to_ten = 1:10 one_to_ten ## [1] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 1.3.3 Naming objects When you assign objects, you will need to choose names for them. This object name is what you will type later in your code to reference the object and use it in functions, figures, etc. For example, with the following code, I am assigning the character string “GoFedEx” to an object that I am naming fedex_number: fedex_number &lt;- &quot;GoFedEx&quot; There are only two fixed rules for naming objects in R: Use only letters, numbers, and underscores Don’t start with anything but a letter In addition to these fixed rules, there are also some guidelines for naming objects that you should adopt now, since they will make your life easier as you advance to writing more complex code in R. The following three guidelines for naming objects are from Hadley Wickham’s R style guide: Use lower case for variable names (fedex_number, not FedExNumber) Use an underscore as a separator (fedex_number, not fedex.number or fedexNumber) Avoid using names that are already defined in R (e.g., don’t name an object mean, because a function named mean already exists) Another good practice is to name objects after nouns (e.g., fedex_number) and later, when you start writing functions, name those after verbs (e.g., call_fedex). You’ll want your object names to be short enough that they don’t take forever to type as you’re coding, but not so short that you can’t remember what they stand for. Sometimes, you’ll want to create an object that you won’t want to keep for very long. For example, you might want to create a small object to test some code, but you plan to not need the object again once you’ve done that. You may want to come up with some short, generic object names that you use for these kinds of objects, so that you’ll know that you can delete them without problems when you want to clean up your R session. There are all kinds of traditions for these placeholder variable names in computer science. foo and bar are two popular choices, as are, evidently, xyzzy, spam, ham, and norf. There are different placeholder names in different languages: for example, toto, truc, and azerty (French); and pippo, pluto, paperino (Disney character names; Italian). See the Wikipedia page on metasyntactic variables to find out more. 1.3.4 Commenting code Sometimes, you’ll want to include notes in your code. You can do this in all programming languages by using a comment character to start the line with your comment. In R, the comment character is the hash symbol, #. R will skip any line that starts with # in a script. For example, if you run the following code: # Don&#39;t print this. &quot;But print this&quot; ## [1] &quot;But print this&quot; R will only print the second, uncommented line. You can also use a comment in the middle of a line, to add a note on what you’re doing in that line of the code. R will skip any part of the code from the hash symbol on. For example: &quot;Print this&quot; ## But not this, it&#39;s a comment. ## [1] &quot;Print this&quot; 1.4 R’s most basic object types An R object stores some type of data that you want to use later in your R code, without fully recreating it. The content of R objects can vary from very simple (the &quot;GoFedEx&quot; string in the example code above) to very complex objects with lots of elements (for example, a machine learning model). There are a variety of different object types in R, shaped to fit different types of objects ranging from the simple to complex. In this section, we’ll start by describing two object types that you will use most often in basic data analysis, vectors (1-dimensional objects) and dataframes (2-dimensional objects). 1.4.1 Vectors To get an initial grasp of the vector object type in R, think of it as a 1-dimensional object, or a string of values. All values in a vector must be of the same class (i.e., all numbers, all characters, all dates). If you try to create a vector with elements from different classes (like “FedEx”, which is a character, and 3, a number), R will coerce all of the elements to the most generic class of any of the elements (i.e., “FedEx” and “3” will both become characters, since “3” can be changed to a character, but “FedEx” can’t be changed to a number). To create a vector from different elements, you’ll use the concatenation function, c to join them together, with commas between the elements. For example, to create a vector with the first five elements of the Fibonacci sequence, you can run: fibonacci &lt;- c(1, 1, 2, 3, 5) fibonacci ## [1] 1 1 2 3 5 Here is an example of creating a vector using elements with the character class instead of numbers (note the quotation marks used around each element for character strings): one_to_five &lt;- c(&quot;one&quot;, &quot;two&quot;, &quot;three&quot;, &quot;four&quot;, &quot;five&quot;) one_to_five ## [1] &quot;one&quot; &quot;two&quot; &quot;three&quot; &quot;four&quot; &quot;five&quot; If you mix classes when you create the vector, R will coerce all the elements to most generic of the elements’ classes: mixed_classes &lt;- c(1, 3, &quot;five&quot;) mixed_classes ## [1] &quot;1&quot; &quot;3&quot; &quot;five&quot; A vector’s length is the number of elements in the vector. You can use the length function to determine a vector’s length: length(mixed_classes) ## [1] 3 Once you create an object, you will often want to reference the whole object in future code. However, there will be some times when you’ll want to reference just certain elements of the object (for example, the first three values). You can pull out certain values from a vector by using indexing with square brackets ([...]) to identify the locations of the elements you want to pull, with a numeric vector inside the brackets that lists the numbered positions of the elements you want to get: fibonacci[2] # Get the second value ## [1] 1 fibonacci[c(1, 5)] # Get first and fifth values ## [1] 1 5 fibonacci[1:3] # Get the first three values ## [1] 1 1 2 You can also use logic to pull out some values of a vector. For example, you might only want to pull out even values from the fibonacci vector. We’ll cover using logical statements to index vectors later in the book. 1.4.2 Dataframes A dataframe is a 2-dimensional object, and is made of one or more vectors of the same length stuck together side-by-side. It is the closest R has to an Excel spreadsheet-type structure. You can create dataframes using the data.frame function. However, most often you will create a dataframe by reading in data from a file, using something like read.csv. To create a dataframe using data.frame, in this case by sticking together vectors you already have saved as R objects, you can run: fibonacci_seq &lt;- data.frame(num_in_seq = one_to_five, fibonacci_num = fibonacci) fibonacci_seq ## num_in_seq fibonacci_num ## 1 one 1 ## 2 two 1 ## 3 three 2 ## 4 four 3 ## 5 five 5 Note that this call requires that the one_to_five and fibonacci vectors are the same length, although they don’t have to be (and in this case aren’t) the same class of objects (one_to_five is a character class, fibonacci is numeric). You can also create a dataframe using data.frame even if you don’t have the vectors for the columns saved as objects. Instead, in this case, you can put the vector assignment directly within the data.frame call: fibonacci_seq &lt;- data.frame(num_in_seq = c(&quot;one&quot;, &quot;two&quot;, &quot;three&quot;, &quot;four&quot;, &quot;five&quot;), fibonacci_num = c(1, 1, 2, 3, 5)) fibonacci_seq ## num_in_seq fibonacci_num ## 1 one 1 ## 2 two 1 ## 3 three 2 ## 4 four 3 ## 5 five 5 You can put more than one function call in a single line of R code, as in this example (the c creates a vector, while the data.frame creates a dataframe, using the vectors created by the calls to c). When you use multiple functions within a single R call, R will evaluate starting from the inner-most parentheses out, much like the order of operations in a math equation with parentheses. The general format for using data.frame is: ## Note: Generic code [name of object] &lt;- data.frame([1st column name] = [1st column content], [2nd column name] = [2nd column content]) with an equals sign between the column name and column content for each column, and commas between each of the columns. You can use square-bracket indexing ([..., ...]) for dataframes, too, but now they’ll have two dimensions (rows, then columns). Put the rows you want before the comma, the columns after. If you want all of something (e.g., all rows in the dataframe), leave the designated spot blank. Here are two examples of using square-bracket indexing to pull a subset of the fibonacci_seq dataframe we created above: fibonacci_seq[1:2, 2] # First two rows, second column ## [1] 1 1 fibonacci_seq[5, ] # Last row, all columns ## num_in_seq fibonacci_num ## 5 five 5 So far, we’ve only shown how to create dataframes from scratch within an R session. Usually, however, you’ll create R dataframes instead by reading in data from an outside file using read.csv and related functions. For example, you might want to analyze data on all the guests that came on the Daily Show, circa Jon Stewart. If you have this data in a comma-separated (csv) file on your computer called “daily_show_guests.csv”, you can read it into your R session with the following code: daily_show &lt;- read.csv(&quot;daily_show_guests.csv&quot;, header = TRUE, skip = 4) In this code, the read.csv function is reading in the data from “daily_show_guests”, while the gets arrow (&lt;-) assigns that data to the object daily_show, which you can then reference in later code to explore and plot the data. Once you’ve read in the data and saved the resulting dataframe as an object, you can use square-bracket indexing to look at the first two rows in the data: daily_show[1:2, ] ## YEAR GoogleKnowlege_Occupation Show Group Raw_Guest_List ## 1 1999 actor 1/11/99 Acting Michael J. Fox ## 2 1999 Comedian 1/12/99 Comedy Sandra Bernhard You can use the functions dim, nrow, and ncol to figure out the dimensions (number of rows and columns) of a dataframe: dim(daily_show) ## [1] 2693 5 nrow(daily_show) ## [1] 2693 ncol(daily_show) ## [1] 5 1.5 Using R functions 1.5.1 Function structure In general, functions in R take the following structure: ## Generic code function.name(parameter 1 = argument 1, parameter 2 = argument 2, parameter 3 = argument 3) The result of the function will be output to your R session, unless you choose to save the output in an object: ## Generic code new_object &lt;- function.name(parameter 1 = argument 1, parameter 2 = argument 2, parameter 3 = argument 3) Here are some example function calls, to give you examples of this structure: head(daily_show) ## YEAR GoogleKnowlege_Occupation Show Group Raw_Guest_List ## 1 1999 actor 1/11/99 Acting Michael J. Fox ## 2 1999 Comedian 1/12/99 Comedy Sandra Bernhard ## 3 1999 television actress 1/13/99 Acting Tracey Ullman ## 4 1999 film actress 1/14/99 Acting Gillian Anderson ## 5 1999 actor 1/18/99 Acting David Alan Grier ## 6 1999 actor 1/19/99 Acting William Baldwin head(daily_show, n = 3) ## YEAR GoogleKnowlege_Occupation Show Group Raw_Guest_List ## 1 1999 actor 1/11/99 Acting Michael J. Fox ## 2 1999 Comedian 1/12/99 Comedy Sandra Bernhard ## 3 1999 television actress 1/13/99 Acting Tracey Ullman daily_show &lt;- read.csv(&quot;daily_show_guests.csv&quot;, skip = 4, header = TRUE) Within the function call, parameters allow you to customize the function to run in a certain way (e.g., use a certain dataframe as an input, give output in a certain format). Some function parameters will have default arguments, which means that you don’t have to put a value for that parameter for the function to run, but you can if you want the function to do something other than the default. 1.5.2 Function help files You can find out more about a function, include what parameters it has and what the default values, if any, are by using ? before the function name in the R console. For example, to find out more about the read.csv command, run: ?read.csv From the “Usage” section of the help file, you can figure out that the only required parameter is file, the pathname of the file that you want to read in, since this is the only argument in the “Usage” example without an argument value: read.csv(file, header = TRUE, sep = &quot;,&quot;, quote = &quot;\\&quot;&quot;, dec = &quot;.&quot;, fill = TRUE, comment.char = &quot;&quot;, ...) You can also see from this “Usage” section that the default value of header is TRUE, the default value of sep is a comma, etc. The “Arguments” section explains each of the parameters, and possible arguments that each can take. For example, here is the explanation of the nrows parameter in the read.csv function: integer: the maximum number of rows to read in. Negative and other invalid values are ignored. From this, you can determine that you should put in a whole number, 1 or higher, and the function will only read in that many lines of the dataframe when you run read.csv. 1.5.3 Function parameters Each function parameter has a name (e.g., nrows, header, file). The safest way to call a function in R is to use the structure parameter name = argument value for every parameter, like this: head(x = daily_show, n = 3) However, you can also give argument values by position. For example, in the head function, the first parameter is x, the object you want to look at, and the second is n, the number of elements you want to include when you look at the object. If you know this, you can call head using the shorter call: head(daily_show, 3) If you use position alone, you will have problems if you don’t include arguments in exactly the right order. However, if you use parameter names to set each argument, it doesn’t matter what order you include arguments when calling a function: # These two calls return the exact same object head(x = daily_show, n = 3) head(n = 3, x = daily_show) Because code tends to be more robust to errors when you use parameter names to set arguments, we recommend against using position, rather than name, to give arguments when calling functions, at least while you’re learning R. It’s too easy to forget the exact order and get errors in your code. However, there is one exception– the first argument to a function is almost always required (i.e., there’s not a default value), and you very quickly learn what the first parameter of most functions are as soon as you start using the function regularly. Therefore, it’s fine to use position alone to specify the first argument in a function, but for now always use the parameter name to set any later arguments: head(daily_show, n = 3) Using the full parameter names for arguments can take a bit more time, since it requires more typing. However, RStudio helps you out with that by offering code completion. Once you start typing the first few letters of a parameter name within a function call, try pressing the tab key. All possible arguments that start with those letters should show up, and you can scroll through to pick the right one, or keep typing until the argument you want is atnthe top of the list of choices, and then press the tab key again. 1.6 In-course Exercise 1.6.1 About the dataset For today’s class, you’ll be using a dataset of all the guests on Jon Stewart’s The Daily Show. This data was originally collected by Nate Silver’s website, FiveThirtyEight and is available on FiveThirtyEight’s GitHub page under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License. The only change made to the original file was to add (commented) attribution information at the start of the file. First, check out a bit more about this data and its source: Check out the Creative Commons license. What are we allowed to do with this data? What restrictions are there on using the data? It’s often helpful to use prior knowledge to help check out or validate your dataset. One thing we might want to know about this data is if it covers the whole time that Jon Stewart hosted The Daily Show. Find out the dates he started and finished as host. Briefly browse around FiveThirtyEight’s GitHub data page. What are some other datasets available that you find interesting? You can scroll to the bottom of the page to get to the compiled README.md content, which gives the full titles and links to relevant datasets. You can also click on any dataset to get more information. Look at the GitHub page for this Daily Show data. How many columns will be in this dataset? What kind of information does the data include? In this exercise, you’re using data posted by FiveThirtyEight on GitHub. We’ll be using a lot of data that’s on GitHub this semester, and GitHub is being used behind-the-scenes for both this book and the course note slides. We’ll talk more about GitHub later, but you might find it interesting to explore a bit now. It’s a place where people can post, work on, and share code in a number of programming languages– it’s been referred to as “Facebook for Nerds”. You can search GitHub repositories and code specifically by programming language, so it can be a good way to find example R code from which to learn. If you have extra time: Check out the related article on FiveThirtyEight. What are some specific questions they used this data to answer for this article? Who is Nate Silver? 1.6.2 Getting the data onto your computer First, download the data from GitHub onto your computer. Make a directory (folder) on your computer specifically for this course (I strongly recommend that you put it somewhere where the file path will not have any spaces in it– for example, putting it in your home directory, under the name “R_Prog_Course” would be great. Putting it in a directory called “R Prog Course” would not.). Put the Daily Show data in your directory for this course. Take the following steps to get the data onto your computer If you do not yet have a directory (folder) just for this course, make one someplace straightforward like in your home directory. Do not use any spaces in the directory name. Download the file from GitHub. Right click on Raw and then choose “Download linked file”. Put the file into the directory you created for this course. Find out what your home directory is in R. To do this, make sure R is set to your home directory using setwd(&quot;~&quot;), and then get R to print that home directory path using getwd(). Outside of R, open Finder (or your system’s equivalent). Go to your home directory (mine, for example, is /Users/brookeanderson). Figure out how to get from your home directory to the directory you created for this course. For example, from my home directory, I would go RProgrammingForResearch to data. Go back into R. Set R’s working directory to your directory for this class using the setwd command, now that you know the pathname for the directory. For example, I would use setwd(&quot;~/RProgrammingForResearch/data&quot;). Use the list.files command to make sure that the “daily_show_guests.csv” file is in your current working directory. The full R code for this task might look something like: setwd(&quot;~&quot;) getwd() setwd(&quot;~/RProgrammingForResearch/data&quot;) getwd() list.files() &quot;daily_show_guests.csv&quot; %in% list.files() If you have extra time: See if you can figure out the last line of code in the example R code. 1.6.3 Getting the data into R Now that you have the dataset in your working directory, you can read it into R. This dataset is in a .csv (comma separated values) format. (We will talk more about different file formats next week.) You can read csv files into R using the read.csv function. Read the data into your R session Use the read.csv function to read the data into R and save it as the object daily_show. Use the help file for the read.csv function to figure out how this function works. To pull that up, use ?read.csv. Why are we using the option header = TRUE? Can you figure out why we’re using the skip option, and why it’s set to 4? Note that you need to put the file name in quotation marks. What would have happened if you’d used read.csv but hadn’t saved the result as the object daily_show? (For example, you’d run the code read.csv(&quot;daily_show_guests.csv&quot;) rather than daily_show &lt;- read.csv(&quot;daily_show_guests.csv&quot;).) Example R code: daily_show &lt;- read.csv(&quot;daily_show_guests.csv&quot;, header = TRUE, skip = 4) If you have extra time: Say this was a really big dataset. You want to check out just the first 10 rows to make sure that you’ve got your code right before you take the time to pull in the whole dataset. Use the help file for read.csv to figure out how to only read in a few rows. Look through the help file for other options available for read.csv. Can you think of examples when some of these options would be useful? Example R code: daily_show_first10 &lt;- read.csv(&quot;daily_show_guests.csv&quot;, header = TRUE, skip = 4, nrows = 10) daily_show_first10 1.6.4 Checking out the data You now have the data available in the daily_show option. You’ll want to check it out to make sure it read in correctly, and also to get a feel for the data. Throughout, you can use the help pages to figure out more about any of the functions being used (for example, ?dim). Take the following steps to check out the dataset Use indexing to look at the first two rows of the dataset. Based on this, what does each row “measure”? What information do you get for each “measurement”? As a reminder, indexing uses square brackets immediately after the object name. If the object has two dimensions, like a dataframe (rows and columns), you put the rows you want, then a comma, then the columns you want. If you want all rows (or columns), you leave that space blank. For example, if you wanted to get the first two rows and the first three columns, you’d use daily_show[1:2, 1:3]. If you wanted to get the first five rows and all the columns, you’d use daily_show[1:5, ]. Use the dim function to find out how many rows and columns this dataframe has. Based on what you found out about the data from the GitHub page, does it have the number of columns you expected? Based on what you know about the data (all the guests who came on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart), do you think it has about the right number of rows? Use the head function to look at the first few rows of the dataframe. Does it look like the rows go in order by date? What was the date of Jon Stewart’s first show? Does it look like this dataset covers that first show? Use the tail function to look at the last few rows of the dataframe. What is the last show date covered by the dataframe? Who was the last guest? Example R code: daily_show[1:2, ] dim(daily_show) head(daily_show) tail(daily_show) If you have extra time: Say you wanted to look at the first ten rows of the dataframe, rather than the first six. How could you use an option with head to do this? Example R code: head(daily_show, n = 10) 1.6.5 Using the data to answer questions Nate Silver was a guest on The Daily Show. Let’s use this data to figure out how many times he was a guest and when he was on the show. Find out more about Nate Silver on The Daily Show Use the subset function to create a new dataframe that only has the rows of daily_show when Nate Silve was a guest. Put it in the object nate_silver. Print out the full nate_silver dataframe by typing nate_silver. (You could just use this to answer both questions, but still try the next steps. They would be important with a bigger dataset.) To count the number of times Nate Silver was a guest, you’ll need to count the number of rows in the new dataset. You can either use the dim function or the nrow function to do this. What additional information does the dim function give you? To get the dates when Nate Silver was a guest, you can print out just the Show column of the dataframe. There are a few ways you can do this using indexing: nate_silver[ , 3] (since Show is the third column), nate_silver[ , &quot;Show&quot;], or nate_silver$Show. Try these. Example R code: nate_silver &lt;- subset(daily_show, Raw_Guest_List == &quot;Nate Silver&quot;) nate_silver dim(nate_silver) nrow(nate_silver) nate_silver[ , 3] nate_silver[ , &quot;Show&quot;] If you have extra time: When you print out the Show column, why does it also print out something underneath about Levels? Hint: This has to do with the class that R has saved this column as. What class is it currently? What other classes might we want to consider converting it to as we continue working with the dataset? Check out the example code below to get some ideas. Was Nate Silver the only statistician to be a guest on the show? What were the occupations that were only represented by one guest visit? Since GoogleKnowlege_Occupation is a factor, you can use the table function to create a new vector with the number of times each value of GoogleKnowlege_Occupation shows up. You can put this information into a new vector and then pull out only the values that equal 1 (so, only had one guest). (Note that “Statistician” doesn’t show up– there was only one person who was a guest, but he had three visits.) Pick your favorite “one-off” example and find out who the guest was for that occupation. Example R code: class(nate_silver$Show) range(nate_silver$Show) nate_silver$Show &lt;- as.Date(nate_silver$Show, format = &quot;%m/%d/%y&quot;) range(nate_silver$Show) diff(range(nate_silver$Show)) # Time between Nate&#39;s first and last shows statisticians &lt;- subset(daily_show, GoogleKnowlege_Occupation == &quot;Statistician&quot;) statisticians num_visits &lt;- table(daily_show[ , 2]) head(num_visits) # Note: This is a vector rather than a dataframe names(num_visits[num_visits == 1]) subset(daily_show, GoogleKnowlege_Occupation == &quot;chess player&quot;) subset(daily_show, GoogleKnowlege_Occupation == &quot;mathematician&quot;) subset(daily_show, GoogleKnowlege_Occupation == &quot;orca trainer&quot;) subset(daily_show, GoogleKnowlege_Occupation == &quot;Puzzle Creator&quot;) subset(daily_show, GoogleKnowlege_Occupation == &quot;Scholar&quot;) "],

An R script is a plain text file where you can save a series of R commands. You can save the script and open it up later to see (or re-do) what you did earlier, just like you could with something like a Word document when you’re writing a paper. To open a new R script in RStudio, go to the menu bar and select “File” -&gt; “New File” -&gt; “R Script”. Alternatively, you can use the keyboard shortcut Command-Shift-N. Figure 2.1 gives an example of an R script file opened in RStudio and points out some of interesting elements. Figure 2.1: Example of an R script in RStudio. To save a script you’re working on, you can click on the “Save” button (which looks like a floppy disk) at the top of your R script window in RStudio or use the keyboard shortcut Command-S. Save R scripts using a “.R” file extension. Within the R script, you’ll usually want to type your code so there’s one command per line. If your command runs long, you can write a single call over multiple lines. It’s unusual to put more than one command on a single line of a script file, but you can if you separate the commands with semicolons (;). These rules all correspond to how you can enter commands at the console. Running R code from a script file is very easy in RStudio. You can use either the “Run” button or Command-Return, and any code that is selected (i.e., that you’ve highlighted with your cursor) will run at the console. You can use this functionality to run a single line of code, multiple lines of code, or even just part of a specific line of code. If no code is highlighted, then R will instead run all the code on the line with the cursor and then move the cursor down to the next line in the script. You can also run all of the code in a script. To do this, use the “Source” button at the top of the script window. You can also run the entire script either from the console or from within another script by using the source() function, with the filename of the script you want to run as the argument. For example, to run all of the code in a file named “MyFile.R” that is saved in your current working directory, run: source(&quot;MyFile.R&quot;) You can add comments into an R script to let others know (and remind yourself) what you’re doing and why. To do this, use R’s comment character, #. Any line on a script line that starts with # will not be read by R. You can also take advantage of commenting to comment out certain parts of code that you don’t want to run at the moment. While it’s generally best to write your R code in a script and run it from there rather than entering it interactively at the R console, there are some exceptions. A main example is when you’re initially checking out a dataset, to make sure you’ve read it in correctly. It often makes more sense to run commands for this task, like str(), head(), tail(), and summary(), at the console. These are all examples of commands where you’re trying to look at something about your data right now, rather than code that builds toward your analysis or helps you read in or clean up your data. 2.2 Directories and pathnames 2.2.1 Directory structure It seems a bit of a pain and a bit complex to have to think about computer directory structure in the “basics” part of this class, but this structure is not terribly complex once you get the idea of it, and they are a couple of very good reasons why it’s worth learning now. First, many of the most frustrating errors you get when you start using R trace back to understanding directories and filepaths. For example, when you try to read a file into R using only the filename, and that file is not in your current working directory, you will get an error like: Error in file(file, &quot;rt&quot;) : cannot open the connection In addition: Warning message: In file(file, &quot;rt&quot;) : cannot open file &#39;Ex.csv&#39;: No such file or directory This error is especially frustrating when you’re new to R because it happens at the very beginning of your analysis– you can’t even get your data in. Also, if you don’t understand a bit about working directories and how R looks for the file you’re ask it to find, you’d have no idea where to start to fix this error. Second, once you understand how to use pathnames, especially relative pathnames, to tell R how to find a file that is in a directory other than your working directory, you will be able to organize all of your files for a project in a much cleaner way. For example, you can create a directory for your project, then create one subdirectory to store all of your R scripts, and another to store all of your data, and so on. This can help you keep very complex projects more structured and easier to navigate. We’ll talk about these ideas more in the course sections on Reproducible Research, but it’s good to start learning the background you’ll need for that (which is how directory structures and filepaths work) early. Your computer organizes files through a collection of directories. Chances are, you are fairly used to working with these in your daily life already (although you may call them “folders” rather than “directories”). For example, you’ve probably created new directories to store data files and Word documents for a specific project. Figure 2.2 illustrates the file directory structure on my computer. (Note that I have omitted many, many additional files and directories– this just shows an example of a few directories and files and how they are structured together). Directories are shown in blue and files in green. Figure 2.2: An example of file directory structure. You can notice a few interesting things from Figure 2.2. First, you might notice the structure includes a few of the directories that you use a lot on your own computer, like Desktop, Documents, and Downloads. Next, the directory at the very top is the computer’s root directory, \\. For a PC, the root directory might something like C:; for Unix and Macs, it’s usually \\. Finally, if you look closely, you’ll notice that it’s possible to have different files in different locations of the directory structure with the same file name. For example, in the figure, there are files names heat_mort.csv in both the CourseText directory and in the example_data directory. These are two different files with different contents, but they can have the same name as long as they’re in different directories. This fact– that you can have files with the same name in different places– should help you appreciate how useful it is that R requires you to give very clear directions to describe exactly which file you want R to read in, if you aren’t reading in something in your current working directory. You will have a home directory somewhere near the top of your structure, although it’s likely not your root directory. My home directory is \\Users\\brookeanderson. I’ll describe just a bit later how you can figure out what your own home directory on your own computer. 2.2.2 Working directory When you run R, it’s always running from within some working directory, which will be one of the directories somewhere in your computer’s directory structure. At any time, you can figure out which directory R is working in by running the command getwd() (short for “get working directory”). For example, my R session is currently running in the following directory: getwd() ## [1] &quot;/home/travis/build/geanders/RProgrammingForResearch&quot; This means that, for my current R session, R is working in the RProgrammingForResearch subdirectory of my brookeanderson directory (which is my home directory). There are a few general rules for which working directory R will start in when you open an R session. These are not absolute rules, but they’re generally true. If you have R closed, and you open it by double-clicking on an R script, then R will generally open with, as its working directory, the directory in which that script is stored. This is often a very convenient convention, because often any of the data you’ll be reading in for that script is somewhere near where the script file is saved in the directory structure. If you open R by double-clicking on the R icon in “Applications” (or something similar on a PC), R will start in its default working directory. You can find out what this is, or change it, in RStudio’s “Preferences”. I have never had a compelling reason to change this on my own computer, as I find it very easy to just move around the directories and set a new working directory using pathnames and the setwd() function. Finally, later in the course, we’ll talk about using R Projects from within RStudio. If you open an R Project, R will start in that project’s working dirctory (the directory in which the .Rproj file for the project is stored). 2.2.3 File and directory pathnames Once you get a picture of how your directories and files are organized, you can use pathnames, either absolute or relative, to move around the directories, set a different working directory, and read in files from different directories than your current working directory. Pathnames are the directions for getting to a directory or file stored on your computer. When you want to reference a directory or file, you can use one of two types of pathnames: Relative pathname: How to get to the file or directory from your current working directory Absolute pathname: How to get to the file or directory from anywhere on the computer Absolute pathnames are a bit more straightforward conceptually, because they don’t depend on your current working directory. However, they’re also a lot longer to write, and they’re much less convenient if you’ll be sharing some of your code with other people who might run it on their own computers. I’ll explain this second point a bit more a little later in this section. Absolute pathnames give the full directions to a directory or file, starting all the way at the root directory. For example, the heat_mort.csv file in the CourseText directory has the absolute pathname: &quot;\\Users\\brookeanderson\\Desktop\\RCourseFall2015\\CourseText\\heat_mort.csv&quot; You can use this absolute pathname to read this file in using read.csv, and this absolute pathname will always work, regardless of your current working directory, because it gives directions from the root, so it will always be clear to R exactly what file you’re talking about. Here’s the code to use to read that file in using the read.csv function with the file’s absolute pathname: heat_mort &lt;- read.csv(&quot;\\Users\\brookeanderson\\Desktop\\RCourseFall2015\\CourseText\\heat_mort.csv&quot;) The relative pathname, on the other hand, gives R the directions for how to get to a directory or file from the current working directory. If the file or directory you’re looking for is pretty close to your current working directory in your directory structure, then a relative pathname can be a much shorter way to tell R how to get to the file than an absolute pathname. However, the relative pathname depends on what your current working directory is, and the relative pathname that works perfectly when you’re working in one directory will not work at all once you move into a different working directory. As an example of a relative pathname, say you’re working in the directory RCourseFall2015 within the file structure shown in Figure 2.2, and you want to read in the heat_mort.csv file in the CourseText directory. To get from RCourseFall2015 to that file, you’d need to look in the subdirectory CourseText, where you could find heat_mort.csv. Therefore, the relative pathname from your working directory would be: &quot;CourseText/heat_mort.csv&quot; You can use this relative pathname to tell R where to find and read in the file: heat_mort &lt;- read.csv(&quot;CourseText/heat_mort.csv&quot;) While this pathname is much shorter than the absolute pathname, it is important to remember that if you changed your working directory (for example, if you used setwd(&quot;CourseText&quot;) to move into the CourseText directory), this relative pathname would no longer work. There are a few abbreviations that can be really useful for pathnames: Shorthand Meaning ~ Home directory . Current working directory .. One directory up from current working directory ../.. Two directories up from current working directory These can help you keep pathnames shorter and also help you move “up-and-over” to get to a file or directory that’s not on the direct path below your current working directory. For example, my home directory is \\Users\\brookeanderson. If I wanted to change my working directory to the Downloads directory, which is a direct sub-directory of my home directory, I could use: setwd(&quot;~/Downloads&quot;) As a second example, say I was working in the working directory CourseText, but I wanted to read in the heat_mort.csv file that’s in the example_data directory, rather than the one in the CourseText directory. I can use the .. abbreviation to tell R to look up one directory from the current working directory, and then down within a subdirectory of that. The relative pathname in this case is: &quot;../Week2_Aug31/example_data/heat_mort.csv&quot; This tells R to look one directory up from the working directory (..), which in this case is to RCourseFall2015, and then down within that directory to Week2_Aug31, then to example_data, and then to look there for the file heat_mort.csv. To read this file in using a relative pathname, then, while R is working in the CourseTest directory, would be: heat_mort &lt;- read.csv(&quot;../Week2_Aug31/example_data/heat_mort.csv&quot;) These relative pathnames would “break” as soon as you tried tham from a different working directory– this fact might make it seem like you would never want to use relative pathnames, and would always want to use absolute ones instead, even if they’re longer. If that were the only consideration (length of the pathname), then perhaps that would be true. However, as you do more and more in R, there will likely be many occasions when you want to use relative pathnames instead. They are particularly useful if you ever want to share a whole directory, with R scripts and data, with a collaborator. In that case, if you’ve used relative pathnames, all the code should work fine for the person you share with, even though they’re running it on their own computer. Conversely, if you’d used absolute pathnames, none of them would work on another computer, because the “top” of the directory structure (i.e., for me, \\Users\\brookeanderson\\Desktop) will almost definitely be different for your collaborator’s computer than it is for yours. You can use absolute or relative pathnames for a number of things: To set your working directory: setwd(&quot;../Week2_Aug31&quot;), for example To read in files from a different directory (as shown in the previous examples) To list files in a different directory: for example, list.files(&quot;..&quot;) will list all files in the directory directly about your current working directory (the parent directory of your working directory) If you’re getting errors reading in files, and you think it’s related to the relative pathname you’re using, it’s often helpful to use list.files() to make sure the file you’re trying to load is in the directory that the relative pathname you’re using is directing R to. 2.3 Diversion: paste This is a good opportunity to explain how to use some functions that can be very helpful when you’re using relative or absolute pathnames: paste() and paste0(). As a bit of important background information, it’s important that you understand that you can save a pathname (absolute or relative) as an R object, and then use that R object in calls to later functions like list.files() and read.csv(). For example, to use the absolute pathname to read the heat_mort.csv file in the CourseText directory, you could run: my_file &lt;- &quot;/Users/brookeanderson/Desktop/RCourseFall2015/CourseText/heat_mort.csv&quot; heat_mort &lt;- read.csv(my_file) You’ll notice from this code that sometimes the pathname to get to a directory or file can sometimes get ungainly long. To keep your code cleaner, you can address this by using the paste or paste0 functions. These functions come in handy in a lot of other applications, too, but this is a good place to introduce them. The paste() function is very straightforward. It takes, as inputs, a series of different character strings you want to join together, and it pastes them together in a single character string. (As a note, this means that your result vector will only be one element long, for basic uses of paste(), while the inputs will be several different character stings.) You separate all the different things you want to paste together using with commas in the function call. For example: paste(&quot;Sunday&quot;, &quot;Monday&quot;, &quot;Tuesday&quot;) ## [1] &quot;Sunday Monday Tuesday&quot; length(c(&quot;Sunday&quot;, &quot;Monday&quot;, &quot;Tuesday&quot;)) ## [1] 3 length(paste(&quot;Sunday&quot;, &quot;Monday&quot;, &quot;Tuesday&quot;)) ## [1] 1 The paste() function has an option called sep =. This tells R what you want to use to separate the values you’re pasting together in the output. The default is for R to use a space, as shown in the example above. To change the separator, you can change this option, and you can put in just about anything you want. For example, if you wanted to paste all the values together without spaces, you could use sep = &quot;&quot;: paste(&quot;Sunday&quot;, &quot;Monday&quot;, &quot;Tuesday&quot;, sep = &quot;&quot;) ## [1] &quot;SundayMondayTuesday&quot; As a shortcut, instead of using the sep = &quot;&quot; option, you could achieve the same thing using the paste0 function. This function is almost exacly like paste, but it defaults to &quot;&quot; (i.e., no space) as the separator between values by default: paste0(&quot;Sunday&quot;, &quot;Monday&quot;, &quot;Tuesday&quot;) ## [1] &quot;SundayMondayTuesday&quot; With pathnames, you will usually not want spaces. Therefore, you could think about using paste0() to write an object with the pathname you want to ultimately use in commands like list.files() and setwd(). This will allow you to keep your code cleaner, since you can now divide long pathnames over multiple lines: my_file &lt;- paste0(&quot;/Users/brookeanderson/Desktop/&quot;, &quot;RCourseFall2015/CourseText/heat_mort.csv&quot;) heat_mort &lt;- read.csv(my_file) You will end up using paste() and paste0() for a lot of other applications, but this is a good example of how you can start using these functions, to start to get a feel for them. 2.4 Getting data into R 2.4.1 Directories You can use setwd() to change your directory. To get to your home directory (for example, mine is “/Users/brookeanderson”), you can use the abbreviation ~. For example, if you want to change into your home directory and print its name, you could run: setwd(&quot;~&quot;) getwd() ## [1] &quot;/Users/brookeanderson&quot; The most straightforward way to read in data is often to put it in your working directory and then read it in using the file name. If you’re working in the directory with the file you want, you should see the file if you list files in the working directory: list.files() ## [1] &quot;_book&quot; &quot;_bookdown.yml&quot; ## [3] &quot;_build.sh&quot; &quot;_deploy.sh&quot; ## [5] &quot;_output.yml&quot; &quot;01-course_info.Rmd&quot; ## [7] &quot;02-prelim.Rmd&quot; &quot;03-databasics.Rmd&quot; ## [9] &quot;book.bib&quot; &quot;data&quot; ## [11] &quot;DESCRIPTION&quot; &quot;figures&quot; ## [13] &quot;homework.Rmd&quot; &quot;index.Rmd&quot; ## [15] &quot;LICENSE&quot; &quot;packages.bib&quot; ## [17] &quot;preamble.tex&quot; &quot;README.md&quot; ## [19] &quot;references.Rmd&quot; &quot;RProgrammingForResearch.Rmd&quot; ## [21] &quot;RProgrammingForResearch.Rproj&quot; &quot;slides&quot; ## [23] &quot;style.css&quot; &quot;toc.css&quot; ## [25] &quot;vocabulary.Rmd&quot; 2.4.2 Taking advantage of paste0 You can create an object with your directory name using paste0, and then use that to set your directory. We’ll take a lot of advantage of this for reading in files. The convention for paste0 is: [object name] &lt;- paste0(&quot;[first thing you want to paste]&quot;, &quot;[what you want to add to that]&quot;, &quot;[more you want to add]&quot;) Here’s an example: my_dir &lt;- paste0(&quot;~/Desktop/RCourseFall2015/&quot;, &quot;Week2_Aug31&quot;) my_dir ## [1] &quot;~/Desktop/RCourseFall2015/Week2_Aug31&quot; setwd(my_dir) 2.5 Reading data into R 2.5.1 Basics of getting data into R Basic approach: Download data to your computer Make sure R is working in the directory with your data (getwd, setwd) Read data into R (read.csv, read.table) Check to make sure the data came in correctly (dim, head, tail, str) 2.5.2 What kind of data can you get into R? The sky is the limit… Flat files Files from other statistical packages (SAS, Excel, Stata, SPSS) Tables on webpages (e.g., the table near the end of this page) Data in a database (e.g., SQL) Really crazy data formats used in other disciplines (e.g., netCDF files from climate folks, MRI data stored in Analyze, NIfTI, and DICOM formats) Data through APIs (e.g., GoogleMaps, Twitter) Incrediably messy data using scan and readLines 2.5.3 Types of flat files R can read in data from a lot of different formats. The only catch: you need to tell R how to do it. To start, we’ll look at flat files: Fixed width files Delimited files “.csv”: Comma-separated values “.tab”, “.tsv”: Tab-separated values Other possible delimiters: colon, semicolon, pipe (“|”) 2.5.4 Reading in flat files R can read any of these types of files using one of the read.table and read.fwf functions. Find out more about those functions with: ?read.table ?read.fwf 2.5.5 read.table family of functions Some of the interesting options with the read.table family of functions are: Option Description sep What is the delimiter in the data? skip How many lines of the start of the file should you skip? header Does the first line you read give column names? as.is Should you bring in strings as characters, not factors? nrows How many rows do you want to read in? na.strings How are missing values coded? All members of the read.table family are doing the same basic thing. The only difference is what defaults they have for the separator (sep) and the decimal point (dec). Members of the read.table family: Function Separator Decimal point read.csv comma period read.csv2 semi-colon comma read.delim tab period read.delim2 tab comma 2.5.6 Reading in online flat files If you’re reading in data from a non-secure webpage (i.e., one that starts with http), if the data is in a “flat-file” format, you can just read it in using the web address as the file name: url &lt;- paste0(&quot;http://www2.unil.ch/comparativegenometrics&quot;, &quot;/docs/NC_006368.txt&quot;) ld_genetics &lt;- read.delim(url, header = TRUE) ld_genetics[1:5, 1:4] ## pos nA nC nG ## 1 500 307 153 192 ## 2 1500 310 169 207 ## 3 2500 319 167 177 ## 4 3500 373 164 168 ## 5 4500 330 175 224 If you want to read in data from a secure webpage (e.g., one that starts with https), then you’ll need to do something different. First, you’ll need to install then load the package repmis: # install.packages(&quot;repmis&quot;) library(repmis) Now you can use the source.data function to read in data from places like GitHub and Dropbox public folders: url &lt;- paste0(&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cmrivers/&quot;, &quot;ebola/master/country_timeseries.csv&quot;) ebola &lt;- source_data(url) ## Downloading data from: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cmrivers/ebola/master/country_timeseries.csv ## SHA-1 hash of the downloaded data file is: ## 6da83b3d2017245217d35989960184234a6c4e7f ebola[1, 1:3] ## Date Day Cases_Guinea ## 1 1/5/2015 289 2776 2.6 Saving data as R objects 2.6.1 Saving R objects You can save an R object you’ve created as an .RData file using save(): save(ebola, file = &quot;Ebola.RData&quot;) list.files() ## [1] &quot;_book&quot; &quot;_bookdown.yml&quot; ## [3] &quot;_build.sh&quot; &quot;_deploy.sh&quot; ## [5] &quot;_output.yml&quot; &quot;01-course_info.Rmd&quot; ## [7] &quot;02-prelim.Rmd&quot; &quot;03-databasics.Rmd&quot; ## [9] &quot;book.bib&quot; &quot;data&quot; ## [11] &quot;DESCRIPTION&quot; &quot;Ebola.RData&quot; ## [13] &quot;figures&quot; &quot;homework.Rmd&quot; ## [15] &quot;index.Rmd&quot; &quot;LICENSE&quot; ## [17] &quot;packages.bib&quot; &quot;preamble.tex&quot; ## [19] &quot;README.md&quot; &quot;references.Rmd&quot; ## [21] &quot;RProgrammingForResearch.Rmd&quot; &quot;RProgrammingForResearch.Rproj&quot; ## [23] &quot;slides&quot; &quot;style.css&quot; ## [25] &quot;toc.css&quot; &quot;vocabulary.Rmd&quot; This saves to your current working directory (unless you specify a different location). 2.6.2 Loading R objects Then you can re-load the object later using load(): rm(ebola) ls() ## [1] &quot;ld_genetics&quot; &quot;my_dir&quot; &quot;url&quot; load(&quot;Ebola.RData&quot;) ls() ## [1] &quot;ebola&quot; &quot;ld_genetics&quot; &quot;my_dir&quot; &quot;url&quot; 2.6.3 Saving R objects One caveat for saving R objects: some people suggest you avoid this if possible, to make your research more reproducible. Imagine someone wants to look at your data and code in 30 years. R might not work the same, so you might not be able to read an .RData file. However, you can open flat files (e.g., .csv, .txt) and R scripts (.R) in text editors– you should still be able to do this regardless of what happens to R. Potential exceptions: You have an object that you need to save that has a structure that won’t work well in a flat file Your starting dataset is really, really large, and it would take a long time for you to read in your data fresh every time 2.7 Cleaning up data in R 2.7.1 Renaming columns Often, you’ll want to change the column names of a dataframe as soon as you bring in the data, especially if the original ones have things like spaces. We’ll look at this in the icd10 data. library(readxl) ## DEFINEDNAME: 20 00 00 01 0b 00 00 00 01 00 00 00 00 00 00 06 3b 00 00 00 00 51 2b 00 00 0a 00 ## DEFINEDNAME: 20 00 00 01 0b 00 00 00 01 00 00 00 00 00 00 06 3b 00 00 00 00 51 2b 00 00 0a 00 ## DEFINEDNAME: 20 00 00 01 0b 00 00 00 01 00 00 00 00 00 00 06 3b 00 00 00 00 51 2b 00 00 0a 00 ## DEFINEDNAME: 20 00 00 01 0b 00 00 00 01 00 00 00 00 00 00 06 3b 00 00 00 00 51 2b 00 00 0a 00 icd10 &lt;- read_excel(&quot;icd-10.xls&quot;) Take a look at the icd10 data we loaded in the exercise: icd10[1:4, ] ## Code ICD Title ## 1 A00-B99 I. Certain infectious and parasitic diseases ## 2 A00-A09 Intestinal infectious diseases ## 3 A00 Cholera ## 4 A00.0 Cholera due to Vibrio cholerae 01, biovar cholerae You can use the colnames() function to find out what the current column names are: colnames(icd10) ## [1] &quot;Code&quot; &quot;ICD Title&quot; You can also rename column names using colnames(). You just put this call on the left of the assignment, and what you want to assign them on the left. The new names will need to be in a vector the same length as the number of columns. colnames(icd10) &lt;- c(&quot;code&quot;, &quot;title&quot;) icd10[1:2, ] ## code title ## 1 A00-B99 I. Certain infectious and parasitic diseases ## 2 A00-A09 Intestinal infectious diseases 2.7.2 Using subset() You will often want to use only a portion of your data. You can use subset() to create a subset, using logical operators. For example, if you wanted to just pull out the rows of the icd10 dataframe that start with the letter “A”, you could run: icd10_a &lt;- subset(icd10, substr(code, 1, 1) == &quot;A&quot;) Here are the ends of the original and the subsetted dataframes: tail(icd10, 2) ## code title ## 11089 Y89.9 Sequelae of unspecified external cause ## 11090 &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; tail(icd10_a, 2) ## code title ## 458 A98.8 Other specified viral hemorrhagic fevers ## 459 A99 Unspecified viral hemorrhagic fever The convention for subset() is: subset([name of dataframe], [logical statement describing which rows to keep], select = [vector with the names of columns to keep]) 2.7.3 Common logical operators in R Operator Meaning Example == equals subset(df, city == &quot;Los Angeles&quot;) != does not equal subset(df, city != &quot;Los Angeles&quot;) %in% is in subset(df, city %in% c(&quot;Los Angeles&quot;, &quot;San Diego&quot;)) is.na() is NA subset(df, is.na(cases)) !is.na() is not NA subset(df, !is.na(cases)) &amp; and subset(df, city == &quot;Los Angeles&quot; &amp; !is.na(cases)) | or subset(df, city == &quot;Los Angeles&quot; | !is.na(cases)) 2.7.4 Adding columns In R, you can use the $ operator after a dataframe to pull out one of its columns. For example: ca_measles &lt;- read.delim(&quot;measles_data/02-09-2015.txt&quot;, header = FALSE, col.names = c(&quot;city&quot;, &quot;count&quot;)) head(ca_measles$count) ## [1] 6 20 2 4 2 34 You can take advantage of this to add new columns to an existing dataframe. For example, this data is from Feb. 9, 2015. We can add a column with the date to ca_measles: ca_measles$date &lt;- rep(&quot;02-09-2015&quot;, length = nrow(ca_measles)) head(ca_measles, 3) ## city count date ## 1 ALAMEDA 6 02-09-2015 ## 2 LOS ANGELES 20 02-09-2015 ## 3 City of Long Beach 2 02-09-2015 Two notes: The previous example uses the rep() function, which will repeat a value length number of times If the value you assign to the new column is not the right length (remember, all columns in a dataframe must be vectors of equal length), R will try to “recycle” it to fill up the dataframe. So, the following call would have been a simpler alternative: ca_measles$date &lt;- &quot;02-09-2015&quot; ca_measles[1:2, ] ## city count date ## 1 ALAMEDA 6 02-09-2015 ## 2 LOS ANGELES 20 02-09-2015 2.7.5 Date class One final common task in cleaning data is to change the class of some of the columns. This is especially common for dates, which will usually be read in as characters or factors. 2.7.6 Vector classes Here are a few common vector classes in R: Class Example character “Chemistry”, “Physics”, “Mathematics” numeric 10, 20, 30, 40 factor Male [underlying number: 1], Female [2] Date “2010-01-01” [underlying number: 14,610] logical TRUE, FALSE To find out the class of a vector, you can use class(): class(ca_measles$date) ## [1] &quot;character&quot; To find out the classes of all columns in a dataframe, you can use str(): str(ca_measles) ## &#39;data.frame&#39;: 13 obs. of 3 variables: ## $ city : Factor w/ 13 levels &quot;ALAMEDA&quot;,&quot;City of Long Beach&quot;,..: 1 4 2 3 5 6 7 8 9 10 ... ## $ count: int 6 20 2 4 2 34 5 6 13 3 ... ## $ date : chr &quot;02-09-2015&quot; &quot;02-09-2015&quot; &quot;02-09-2015&quot; &quot;02-09-2015&quot; ... 2.7.7 Converting to Date class To convert a vector to the Date class, you can use as.Date(): ca_measles$date &lt;- as.Date(ca_measles$date, format = &quot;%m-%d-%Y&quot;) head(ca_measles$date, 3) ## [1] &quot;2015-02-09&quot; &quot;2015-02-09&quot; &quot;2015-02-09&quot; class(ca_measles$date) ## [1] &quot;Date&quot; Once you have an object in the Date class, you can do things like plot by date, calculate the range of dates, and calculate the total number of days the dataset covers: range(ca_measles$date) ## [1] &quot;2015-02-09&quot; &quot;2015-02-09&quot; diff(range(ca_measles$date)) ## Time difference of 0 days The only tricky thing is learning the abbreviations for the format option. Here are some common ones: Abbreviation Meaning %m Month as a number (e.g., 1, 05) %B Full month name (e.g., August) %b Abbreviated month name (e.g., Aug) %y Two-digit year (e.g., 99) %Y Four-digit year (e.g., 1999) %A Full weekday (e.g., Monday) %a Abberviated weekday (e.g., Mon) Here are some examples: Your date format = 10/23/2008 “%m/%d%Y” 08-10-23 “%y-%m-%d” Oct. 23 2008 “%b. %d %Y” October 23, 2008 “%B %d, %Y” Thurs, 23 October 2008 “%a, %d %B %Y” 2.8 In-course Exercise 2.8.1 Checking out directory structures Download the whole directory for this week from Github. Put the “data” directory as a subdirectory in your directory for this class. To do that, go the the GitHub page for the course and, in the top right, choose “Clone or Download” and then choose “Download ZIP”. Then move the “data” subdirectory into your course directory and throw away rest of what you downloaded. Unfortunately, while GitHub will let you download data files one at a time, it doesn’t offer a straightforward way of downloading a whole subdirectory from a repository. For this task, where you’re pulling all of the data in the “data” subdirectory of the course repository, the quickest method is to download the entire directory, find and move the subdirectory that you need, and then delete the rest. Look through the structure of the “data” directory. What files are in the directory? What subdirectories? Sketch out the structure of this directory. Create a new R script to put all the code you use for this exercise. Create a subdirectory in your course directory called “R” and save this script there using a .R extension (e.g., “week_2.R”). 2.8.2 Using relative and absolute file pathnames Once you have the data, I’d like you to try using setwd() to move around the directories on your computer. For this section of the exercise, you’ll try to open the same file from different working directories, to get practice using absolute and relative file pathnames. Start by changing your working directory to the “data” subdirectory you just downloaded. For me, the absolute path to that is /Users/brookeanderson/RProgrammingForResearch/data, so to change my working directory to this one using an absolute file pathname, I would run: setwd(&quot;/Users/brookeanderson/RProgrammingForResearch/data&quot;) getwd() The absolute pathname will be different for each person, based on the directories on his or her computer and where he or she saved this particular directory. Since “~” is shorthand for my home directory (“/Users/brookeanderson”), I could also use the absolute pathname “~/RProgrammingForResearch/data” when setting this directory as my working directory. Now, use the list.files function to make sure you have all the files that you just pulled in your current working directory: list.files() ## character(0) Try the following tasks: Read in the ebola data in country_timeseries.csv. Save it as the R object ebola. How many rows and columns does it have? What are the names of the columns? Now try moving up one directory from your current working directory (which should be the “data” directory), into the directory you created for this course. What happens if you use the same code as before to read in the file? What do you need to change to be able to read the file in from here? Try to read in the data from here using: A relative pathname An absolute pathname Now move down into the subdirectory of “data” called “measles_data”. Try to read in the Ebola data from this working directory using: A relative pathname An absolute pathname Which method (absolute or relative pathnames) always used the same code, regardless of your current working directory? Which method used different code, depending on the starting working directory? Example R code: getwd() ## Make sure you&#39;re in the &quot;data&quot; directory to start ## [1] &quot;/Users/brookeanderson/RProgrammingForResearch/data&quot; ebola &lt;- read.csv(&quot;country_timeseries.csv&quot;, header = TRUE) ebola[1:5, 1:5] ## Date Day Cases_Guinea Cases_Liberia Cases_SierraLeone ## 1 1/5/2015 289 2776 NA 10030 ## 2 1/4/2015 288 2775 NA 9780 ## 3 1/3/2015 287 2769 8166 9722 ## 4 1/2/2015 286 NA 8157 NA ## 5 12/31/2014 284 2730 8115 9633 dim(ebola) # To figure out number of rows and columns ## [1] 122 18 colnames(ebola) # To figure out column names ## [1] &quot;Date&quot; &quot;Day&quot; &quot;Cases_Guinea&quot; ## [4] &quot;Cases_Liberia&quot; &quot;Cases_SierraLeone&quot; &quot;Cases_Nigeria&quot; ## [7] &quot;Cases_Senegal&quot; &quot;Cases_UnitedStates&quot; &quot;Cases_Spain&quot; ## [10] &quot;Cases_Mali&quot; &quot;Deaths_Guinea&quot; &quot;Deaths_Liberia&quot; ## [13] &quot;Deaths_SierraLeone&quot; &quot;Deaths_Nigeria&quot; &quot;Deaths_Senegal&quot; ## [16] &quot;Deaths_UnitedStates&quot; &quot;Deaths_Spain&quot; &quot;Deaths_Mali&quot; ## Move up one directory setwd(&quot;..&quot;) getwd() ## Get the file using the relative pathname ebola &lt;- read.csv(&quot;data/country_timeseries.csv&quot;, header = TRUE) ebola[1:5, 1:5] ## Date Day Cases_Guinea Cases_Liberia Cases_SierraLeone ## 1 1/5/2015 289 2776 NA 10030 ## 2 1/4/2015 288 2775 NA 9780 ## 3 1/3/2015 287 2769 8166 9722 ## 4 1/2/2015 286 NA 8157 NA ## 5 12/31/2014 284 2730 8115 9633 ## Get the file using the absolute pathname abs_path &lt;- paste0(&quot;/Users/brookeanderson/RProgrammingForResearch/&quot;, &quot;data/country_timeseries.csv&quot;) abs_path ## [1] &quot;/Users/brookeanderson/RProgrammingForResearch/data/country_timeseries.csv&quot; ebola &lt;- read.csv(abs_path, header = TRUE) ebola[1:5, 1:5] ## Date Day Cases_Guinea Cases_Liberia Cases_SierraLeone ## 1 1/5/2015 289 2776 NA 10030 ## 2 1/4/2015 288 2775 NA 9780 ## 3 1/3/2015 287 2769 8166 9722 ## 4 1/2/2015 286 NA 8157 NA ## 5 12/31/2014 284 2730 8115 9633 ## Reset your working directory as your directory for this course ## and then check that you&#39;re in the right place getwd() ## [1] &quot;/Users/brookeanderson/RProgrammingForResearch&quot; ## Move into the measles_data subdirectory setwd(&quot;data/measles_data&quot;) getwd() ## [1] &quot;/Users/brookeanderson/RProgrammingForResearch/data/measles_data&quot; ## Get the file using the relative pathname ebola &lt;- read.csv(&quot;../country_timeseries.csv&quot;, header = TRUE) ebola[1:5, 1:5] ## Date Day Cases_Guinea Cases_Liberia Cases_SierraLeone ## 1 1/5/2015 289 2776 NA 10030 ## 2 1/4/2015 288 2775 NA 9780 ## 3 1/3/2015 287 2769 8166 9722 ## 4 1/2/2015 286 NA 8157 NA ## 5 12/31/2014 284 2730 8115 9633 # Get the file using the absolute pathname (note: we&#39;ve already assigned # the absolute pathname in the `abs_path` object, so we can just use that # object in the `read.csv` call here, rather than typing out the full # absolute pathname again.) ebola &lt;- read.csv(abs_path, header = TRUE) ebola[1:5, 1:5] ## Date Day Cases_Guinea Cases_Liberia Cases_SierraLeone ## 1 1/5/2015 289 2776 NA 10030 ## 2 1/4/2015 288 2775 NA 9780 ## 3 1/3/2015 287 2769 8166 9722 ## 4 1/2/2015 286 NA 8157 NA ## 5 12/31/2014 284 2730 8115 9633 If you have extra time: Find out some more about this Ebola dataset by checking out Caitlin Rivers’ Ebola data GitHub repository.

On the results page, scroll down and use the “Language” sidebar on the left to choose repositories with R code. Did you find any interesting projects?

Why does this listing not have a file extension? 2.8.3 Reading in different types of files First, make sure your reset your working directory to your course directory: setwd(&quot;~/RProgrammingForResearch/&quot;) Now you’ll try reading in data from a variety of types of file formats. All of these files are stored in the “data” subdirectory of your current working directory, so you’ll use filenames throughout that start with “data/”. Try the following tasks: What type of flat file do you think the “ld_genetics.txt” file is? See if you can read it in and save it as the R object ld_genetics. Use the summary function to check out basic statistics on the data. Check out the file “measles_data/02-09-2015.txt”. What type of flat file do you think it is? Stay in the “data” directory and use a relative pathname to read the file in and save it as the R object ca_measles. Use the col.names option to name the columns “city” and “count”. What would the default column names be if you didn’t use this option? Read in the Excel file “icd-10.xls” and assign it to the object name idc10. Use the readxl package to do that (examples are at the bottom of the linked page). Read in the SAS file icu.sas7bdat. To do this, use the haven package. Read the file into the R object icu. Example R code: ld_genetics &lt;- read.delim(&quot;data/ld_genetics.txt&quot;, header = TRUE) summary(ld_genetics) ## pos nA nC nG ## Min. : 500 Min. :185 Min. :120.0 Min. : 85.0 ## 1st Qu.: 876000 1st Qu.:288 1st Qu.:173.0 1st Qu.:172.0 ## Median :1751500 Median :308 Median :190.0 Median :189.0 ## Mean :1751500 Mean :309 Mean :191.9 Mean :191.8 ## 3rd Qu.:2627000 3rd Qu.:329 3rd Qu.:209.0 3rd Qu.:208.0 ## Max. :3502500 Max. :463 Max. :321.0 Max. :326.0 ## nT GCsk TAsk cGCsk ## Min. :188.0 Min. :-189.0000 Min. :-254.000 Min. : -453 ## 1st Qu.:286.0 1st Qu.: -30.0000 1st Qu.: -36.000 1st Qu.:10796 ## Median :306.0 Median : 0.0000 Median : -2.000 Median :23543 ## Mean :307.2 Mean : -0.1293 Mean : -1.736 Mean :22889 ## 3rd Qu.:328.0 3rd Qu.: 29.0000 3rd Qu.: 32.500 3rd Qu.:34940 ## Max. :444.0 Max. : 134.0000 Max. : 205.000 Max. :46085 ## cTAsk ## Min. :-6247 ## 1st Qu.: 1817 ## Median : 7656 ## Mean : 7855 ## 3rd Qu.:15036 ## Max. :19049 ca_measles &lt;- read.delim(&quot;data/measles_data/02-09-2015.txt&quot;, header = FALSE, col.names = c(&quot;city&quot;, &quot;count&quot;)) head(ca_measles) ## city count ## 1 ALAMEDA 6 ## 2 LOS ANGELES 20 ## 3 City of Long Beach 2 ## 4 City of Pasadena 4 ## 5 MARIN 2 ## 6 ORANGE 34 library(readxl) icd10 &lt;- read_excel(&quot;data/icd-10.xls&quot;) ## DEFINEDNAME: 20 00 00 01 0b 00 00 00 01 00 00 00 00 00 00 06 3b 00 00 00 00 51 2b 00 00 0a 00 ## DEFINEDNAME: 20 00 00 01 0b 00 00 00 01 00 00 00 00 00 00 06 3b 00 00 00 00 51 2b 00 00 0a 00 ## DEFINEDNAME: 20 00 00 01 0b 00 00 00 01 00 00 00 00 00 00 06 3b 00 00 00 00 51 2b 00 00 0a 00 ## DEFINEDNAME: 20 00 00 01 0b 00 00 00 01 00 00 00 00 00 00 06 3b 00 00 00 00 51 2b 00 00 0a 00 head(icd10) ## Code ICD Title ## 1 A00-B99 I.

If so, try to read the data in using that function. Why can you use both read.delim and read.table to read in this file? Example R code: ## Using the read.table function ld_genetics &lt;- read.table(&quot;data/ld_genetics.txt&quot;, header = TRUE, sep = &quot;\\t&quot;) ld_genetics[1:5, 1:5] ## pos nA nC nG nT ## 1 500 307 153 192 348 ## 2 1500 310 169 207 314 ## 3 2500 319 167 177 337 ## 4 3500 373 164 168 295 ## 5 4500 330 175 224 271 2.8.4 Cleaning up data Try out the following tasks: You now have an R object called ebola. Create an object called ebola_liberia that only has the columns with the Date and cases and deaths in Liberia. How many observations do you have? Change the column names to date, cases, and deaths. What class is the date column currently in? Convert it to a Date object. If it’s currently a factor, you will need to first convert it to a character (do you know why)? What are the starting and ending dates of this data? This data has earliest dates last and latest dates first. Often, we want our data in chronological order. Change the dataset so it’s in chronological order. Hint: You can use row indices to do this, if you use row indices to list the data from last row to first. For example, what do you get if you do 3:1? What about if you do ebola[3:1, ]? Think of how you can extend this, along with nrow() do this task. Example R code: ## Create a subset with just the Liberia columns and Date ebola_liberia &lt;- subset(ebola, select = c(&quot;Date&quot;, &quot;Cases_Liberia&quot;, &quot;Deaths_Liberia&quot;)) head(ebola_liberia) ## Date Cases_Liberia Deaths_Liberia ## 1 1/5/2015 NA NA ## 2 1/4/2015 NA NA ## 3 1/3/2015 8166 3496 ## 4 1/2/2015 8157 3496 ## 5 12/31/2014 8115 3471 ## 6 12/28/2014 8018 3423 ## How many rows does the whole dataset have? nrow(ebola_liberia) ## [1] 122 ## Rename the columns colnames(ebola_liberia) &lt;- c(&quot;date&quot;, &quot;cases&quot;, &quot;deaths&quot;) ebola_liberia[1:3, ] ## date cases deaths ## 1 1/5/2015 NA NA ## 2 1/4/2015 NA NA ## 3 1/3/2015 8166 3496 ## What class is the `date` column? class(ebola_liberia$date) ## [1] &quot;factor&quot; ## Change the class to a character and then to a Date ## Use the `format` option to tell R what format the date ## currently is in ebola_liberia$date &lt;- as.character(ebola_liberia$date) ebola_liberia$date &lt;- as.Date(ebola_liberia$date, format = c(&quot;%m/%d/%Y&quot;)) head(ebola_liberia$date) ## [1] &quot;2015-01-05&quot; &quot;2015-01-04&quot; &quot;2015-01-03&quot; &quot;2015-01-02&quot; &quot;2014-12-31&quot; ## [6] &quot;2014-12-28&quot; ## What are the starting and ending dates? range(ebola_liberia$date) ## [1] &quot;2014-03-22&quot; &quot;2015-01-05&quot; ## Re-order the dataset from last to first ebola_liberia &lt;- ebola_liberia[nrow(ebola_liberia):1, ] ebola_liberia[1, ] ## date cases deaths ## 122 2014-03-22 NA NA If you have extra time: Limit the ebola_liberia dataset just to the days with non-missing case data. How many observations do you have now? Try using the basic plotting function, plot(), to plot the number of cases over time. Do you think that the cases variable is measuring the count of cases for that day, or the cumulative number of cases up to that day? See if you can figure out more on Caitlin Rivers’ GitHub documentation. Do you notice any potential data quality issues in this data? Hint: The plot() function takes, as required arguments, the vector you want to plot on the x-axis and then the vector you want to plot on the y-axis, like plot([x vector], [y vector]). If you are pulling the vectors from a dataset, you will need to use indexing to pull out the column you want as a vector, like plot([dataframe name]$[column name for x], [dataframe]$[column name for y]). Example R code: ## Remove observations with missing cases ebola_liberia &lt;- subset(ebola_liberia, !is.na(cases)) nrow(ebola_liberia) ## [1] 83 ## Plot the data plot(ebola_liberia$date, ebola_liberia$cases) 2.8.5 A taste of what’s to come… Here’s an example to give you a feel for why it’s worth learning all these different things about directories, list.files, and pathnames. The measles_data subdirectory includes counts of measles made at different times in different cities in California. Say that we wanted to read them all in and make put them into one long dataframe with the variables city, count, and date. You can put together the things you’ve learned so far, along with a few new ideas (including doing a loop), to do this very easily. We’ll talk more later about using loops and functions to make your programming more efficient, but for right now just look through this code and see if you can get a feel for how it’s working (make sure your directory for this course is your working directory): ## Create a vector of all the file names in the `measles_data` subdirectory measles_files &lt;- list.files(&quot;data/measles_data&quot;) measles_files ## [1] &quot;02-09-2015.txt&quot; &quot;02-11-2015.txt&quot; &quot;02-13-2015.txt&quot; &quot;02-18-2015.txt&quot; ## [5] &quot;02-20-2015.txt&quot; &quot;02-23-2015.txt&quot; &quot;02-25-2015.txt&quot; &quot;02-27-2015.txt&quot; ## [9] &quot;03-02-2015.txt&quot; &quot;03-06-2015.txt&quot; &quot;03-13-2015.txt&quot; &quot;03-20-2015.txt&quot; ## [13] &quot;03-27-2015.txt&quot; &quot;04-03-2015.txt&quot; &quot;04-10-2015.txt&quot; &quot;04-17-2015.txt&quot; ## Create a vector of all the dates for files by taking the ## `.txt` off each of these file names and change it into ## a date measles_dates &lt;- sub(&quot;.txt&quot;, &quot;&quot;, measles_files) measles_dates ## [1] &quot;02-09-2015&quot; &quot;02-11-2015&quot; &quot;02-13-2015&quot; &quot;02-18-2015&quot; &quot;02-20-2015&quot; ## [6] &quot;02-23-2015&quot; &quot;02-25-2015&quot; &quot;02-27-2015&quot; &quot;03-02-2015&quot; &quot;03-06-2015&quot; ## [11] &quot;03-13-2015&quot; &quot;03-20-2015&quot; &quot;03-27-2015&quot; &quot;04-03-2015&quot; &quot;04-10-2015&quot; ## [16] &quot;04-17-2015&quot; class(measles_dates) ## [1] &quot;character&quot; measles_dates &lt;- as.Date(measles_dates, format = &quot;%m-%d-%Y&quot;) measles_dates ## [1] &quot;2015-02-09&quot; &quot;2015-02-11&quot; &quot;2015-02-13&quot; &quot;2015-02-18&quot; &quot;2015-02-20&quot; ## [6] &quot;2015-02-23&quot; &quot;2015-02-25&quot; &quot;2015-02-27&quot; &quot;2015-03-02&quot; &quot;2015-03-06&quot; ## [11] &quot;2015-03-13&quot; &quot;2015-03-20&quot; &quot;2015-03-27&quot; &quot;2015-04-03&quot; &quot;2015-04-10&quot; ## [16] &quot;2015-04-17&quot; ## Before I show the loop, let me talk you through some ## of the parts of it: i &lt;- 1 # I&#39;m setting the index to 1 ## Now I&#39;ll use `paste0` to create the first file name ## I want to read. file_name &lt;- paste0(&quot;data/measles_data/&quot;, measles_files[i]) file_name ## [1] &quot;data/measles_data/02-09-2015.txt&quot; ## Now I&#39;ll read in that file df &lt;- read.delim(file_name, header = FALSE, col.names = c(&quot;city&quot;, &quot;count&quot;)) head(df) ## city count ## 1 ALAMEDA 6 ## 2 LOS ANGELES 20 ## 3 City of Long Beach 2 ## 4 City of Pasadena 4 ## 5 MARIN 2 ## 6 ORANGE 34 ## Now I&#39;ll add on a column with the date for all the ## values from that file.

["appendix-b-homework.html", "B Appendix B: Homework B.1 Homework #1 B.2 Homework #2 B.3 Homework #3 B.4 Homework #4 B.5 Homework #5 B.6 Homework #6", " B Appendix B: Homework The following are six homework assignments for the course. B.1 Homework #1 Due date: Sept. 14 For your first homework assignment, you’ll be working through a few swirl lessons that are relevant to the material we’ve covered so far. Swirl is a platform that helps you learn R in R - you can complete the lessons right in your R console. B.1.1 Getting started First, you’ll need to install the swirl package: install.packages(&quot;swirl&quot;) Next, load the swirl package. We’re going to download a course from swirl’s course repository called R Programming Alt using the function install_from_swirl(). Then call the swirl() function to enter the interactive platform: library(swirl) install_from_swirl(&quot;R Programming Alt&quot;) swirl() Note: after calling swirl(), you may be prompted to clear your workspace variables by running rm=(list=ls()). Running this code will clear any variables you already have saved in your global environment. While swirl recommends that you do this, it’s not necessary. B.1.2 Swirl lessons Sign in with your name, and choose the R Programming Alt course. You will need to work through the following lessons: Basic Building Blocks Vectors Missing Values Subsetting Vectors Logic Looking at Data Dates and Times Each lesson should take about 10-15 minutes, but some are much shorter. You’ll be able to get started on some of these lessons after your first day in class (Basic Building Blocks, for example), but others cover topics that we’ll get to in weeks 2 and 3. Whether or not we’ve covered a swirl topic in class, you should be able to successfully work through the lesson. At the end of each lesson, you’ll be prompted to “inform someone about your successful completion of this lesson.” after answering 1 for ‘Yes,’ enter your full name, and enter rachel.severson@colostate.edu as the email address of the person you’d like to notify. You should be sending 7 emails in total. B.1.3 Special swirl commands In the swirl environment, knowing about the following commands will be helpful: Within each lesson, the prompt ... indicates that you should hit Enter to move on to the next section. play(): temporarily exit swirl. It can be useful during a swirl lesson to play around in the R console to try things out. nxt(): regain swirl’s attention after play()ing around in the console. main(): return to swirl’s main menu. bye(): exit swirl. Swirl will save your progress if you exit in the middle of a lesson. You can also hit the Esc. key to exit. (To re-enter swirl, run swirl(). In a new R session you will have to first load the swirl library: library(swirl).) B.1.3.1 For fun While they aren’t required for class, you should consider trying out some other swirl lessons later in the course. The Functions lesson, as well as lapply and sapply and vapply and tapply could be particularly useful. You can also look through the course directory to see what other courses and lessons are available. B.2 Homework #2 Due date: Sept. 28 [R Markdown homework assignment] B.3 Homework #3 Due date: Oct. 12 [dplyr, tidy data homework assignment] B.4 Homework #4 Due date: Oct. 26 [Advanced R Markdown homework assignment] B.5 Homework #5 Due date: Nov. 9 [Homework on functions, regular expressions, and web data assignment] B.6 Homework #6 Due date: Nov. 30 [Mapping homework assignment] "],
